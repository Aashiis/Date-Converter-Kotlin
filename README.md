# Date-Converter-Kotlin
`
LocalDateTime.now().toNepaliDateTime()
`
It is simple and easy
I have found a package in flutter named nepali_utils and this is very useful when you want to use nepali date time in your app but I never found same kind of package for native so it will be very helpful in your project.
